## Compile
You need to use android-ndk-r14b when compiling libuvccamera. If you don't modify the code in libuvccamera, you can also use the pre-compiled library. You can modify it like this:  
libuvccamera/build.gradle
```
tasks.withType(JavaCompile) {
	//compileTask -> compileTask.dependsOn ndkBuild
}
```

If you want to compile libuvccamera, you first need to download [android-ndk-r14b](https://dl.google.com/android/repository/android-ndk-r14b-windows-x86.zip?utm_source=androiddevtools&utm_medium=website), then you can configure local.properties like this:
```
ndk.dir=F\:\\android\\sdk\\ndk-bundle
uvccamera.ndk.dir=F\:\\android\\android-ndk-r11b
sdk.dir=F\:\\android\\sdk
```

Regarding the signature key you can configure local.properties like this:
```
keystore.path=xxx
keystore.alias=xxx
keystore.store_password=xxx
keystore.key_password=xxx
```




## Using AndroidStressTest in your device
1. Download
2. System Signature
3. Installation

System signature:

	$java -jar SignApk.jar platform.x509.pem platform.pk8 AndroidStressTest.apk AndroidStressTest_signed.apk

NOTE:
* System permissions are required for tests such as rebooting and restoring the factory, because system signature is required
* Because the test of restarting and restoring the factory needs to be booted from the boot, and some devices prohibit the booting of the third-party APP, you can push this APP to System/app to solve it.
